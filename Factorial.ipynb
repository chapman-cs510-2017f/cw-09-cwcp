    "The algorithm initializes the variable \"fac\" as the integer value n, which is the input. Then, the algorithm continually multiplies by $n-1$, by reduicing n by 1 and multiplying. When $n=0$, the algorithm terminates. \n",

    "\n",
    "The two problems with the current function definition is that $0!$ is not equal to 1 and the while loops multiplies by 0 on the last iteration, resulting in the factorial being 0. \n",
